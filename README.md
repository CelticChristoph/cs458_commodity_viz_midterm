Both members feel that contributions were evenly shared. If there are questions regarding this, we can gladly explain in person.

A "broken" version of the website can be seen at: http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~carlsenc/cs458_midterm/

Unfortunately the server (even with permissions set) appears to not allow us to host it there properly.
Because of this, we will gladly demo the project if necessary.
